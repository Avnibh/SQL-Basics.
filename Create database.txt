The SQL CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.

Syntax
The basic syntax of this CREATE DATABASE statement is as follows -

CREATE DATABASE DatabaseName;
Always the database name should be unique within the RDBMS.

Example
If you want to create a new database <testDB>, then the CREATE DATABASE statement would be as shown below -

SQL> CREATE DATABASE testDB;
Make sure you have the admin privilege before creating any database. Once a database is created, you can check it in the list of databases as follows -

SQL> SHOW DATABASES;
